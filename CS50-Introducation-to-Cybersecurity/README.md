Total five topics.

0. Securing Accounts

   -> Use at least an 8-character password(Alphabets, Numbers, Special Characters), which decreases the (6,095,689,385,410,816)possibility of being compromised.

   -> It is not a good idea to change passwords periodically.

   -> Limit your wrong attempts.

   -> Two Factor Authentication (2FA) (Knowledge, Possession, Inherence).

   -> Use Password Manager.

   -> Use Single Sign On.

1. Securing Data

   -> Hashing (Password -> Hash) input→ f(input)→ output

   -> Dictionary Attack, Brute-Force Attack, Rainbow Tables Attack, Salting.     

   -> One-Way Hash Function / Cryptographic Hash Function (Arbitrary Length -> Fixed Length)

   Cryptography:

    -> Codes: (Encode: Plaintext -> Codetext) || (Decode: Codetext -> Plaintext)

    -> Cipher: (Encrypt: Plaintext -> Ciphertext) || (Decrypt: Ciphertext -> Plaintext)

    Secret-Key Cryptography:
   
      Symmetric-Key Encryption: Users use the exact same key. (Key+Plaintext → Ciphertext) Example: AES, Triple DES.

      Public-Key Cryptography:
